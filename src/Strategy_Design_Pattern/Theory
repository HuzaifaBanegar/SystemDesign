Methodology:

- Main client class (example google) where we want to extract the type of path we want (that is bike, car, walk etc)
- Get the path class through factory method ( PathCalculatorFactory )
- Initialize one common interface which will be implemented by all these classes ( PathCalculator strategy )
- Now implement this interface by all the path to get the path.
